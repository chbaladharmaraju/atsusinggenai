            "Okay, Bala! Let's analyze your resume for a \"Full Stack Developer\" role.\n",
            "\n",
            "**ATS Score: 90/100**\n",
            "\n",
            "**Analysis:**\n",
            "\n",
            "Your resume is very strong for a full-stack developer role, especially for someone who is still studying for their B.Tech. You've clearly listed relevant skills and demonstrated them through concrete projects. The ATS will pick up a vast majority of the keywords typically associated with full-stack development.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Strengths:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Excellent Keyword Density:** Your \"Skills\" section is packed with highly relevant keywords for both frontend (React.js, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind CSS) and backend (Django, Node.js, RESTful APIs, Python) development, as well as databases (MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite) and core CS concepts.\n",
            "2.  **Project-Based Evidence:** You don't just list skills; you immediately back them up with projects that clearly demonstrate your proficiency in those technologies (e.g., React.js for Movie Search and CrizScore, Django for Social Media).\n",
            "3.  **Relevant Tech Stack:** Your chosen tech stack (React, Django, Node.js) is highly sought after for full-stack roles.\n",
            "4.  **Quantifiable Achievements (Partial):** \"Improved model accuracy by 25% through optimization techniques\" is a fantastic quantifiable achievement in your Human Pose Estimation project.\n",
            "5.  **Good Formatting:** The resume is well-organized, easy to read, and uses bullet points effectively, which ATS systems prefer.\n",
            "6.  **Tools Proficiency:** Including Git, GitHub, VS Code, and Figma shows you're familiar with essential development tools and even UI/UX concepts.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Areas for Improvement (To reach closer to 100%):**\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Clarify Education Dates:**\n",
            "    *   \"B.Tech in Computer Science (AI & DS) 2024 – Present\": This is a bit confusing. Does \"2024 – Present\" mean you *started* in 2024 and are currently pursuing it, with an expected graduation in 2028 (or similar)? Or is \"2024\" your expected graduation year? It would be clearer if you wrote \"Expected Graduation: 2028\" (or whatever the year is) or \"Pursuing B.Tech (Started 2024).\"\n",
            "2.  **Quantify More Achievements:**\n",
            "    *   While you have one great quantifiable point, try to add more metrics to your other projects. For example:\n",
            "        *   **Movie Search:** \"Implemented dynamic search with efficient state management, *reducing search latency by X%*.\"\n",
            "        *   **Social Media:** \"Implemented user authentication, posts, likes, and follow functionality, *supporting X number of users/interactions*.\"\n",
            "        *   **CrizScore:** \"Designed a responsive UI with Tailwind CSS and React Hooks, *achieving Y user satisfaction score/fast load times*.\"\n",
            "    *   Even for your internship: \"Developed real-time skeleton tracking and activity recognition, *improving detection speed by X% or accuracy by Y%*.\"\n",
            "3.  **Professional Summary/Objective:** Consider adding a brief (2-3 sentences) professional summary at the top, right below your contact information. This is a great place to highlight your career goals (e.g., \"Motivated Full Stack Developer with experience in React.js, Django, and Node.js...\") and include more keywords relevant to the specific job description.\n",
            "4.  **Tailor to Specific Job Descriptions:** While this is a general score, always remember to tweak your resume slightly for each job application. If a JD emphasizes a specific technology (e.g., \"strong Node.js experience\"), make sure \"Node.js\" appears multiple times in your skills, projects, and potentially your summary.\n",
            "5.  **Icons in Contact Info:** The `/♀nednLinkedIn` and `/gtbGitHub` might not render correctly in all ATS systems. It's safer to just provide the hyperlinks as plain text or use the actual icons if you're sure they'll render (e.g., on a PDF where you've embedded them). For ATS, `LinkedIn Profile | GitHub Profile` with clear hyperlinks is best.\n",
            "6.  **Certification Relevance:** Your \"Salesforce Certified Agentforce Specialist\" certification is good, showing broader technical aptitude. However, if a particular full-stack role is *very* specialized and doesn't involve Salesforce, you might consider if that space could be used for more full-stack related achievements or skills. For most general full-stack roles, it's fine as it demonstrates a willingness to learn and certify. The AI/ML skills are also great for showing diverse capabilities, even if the primary role is full-stack, as modern applications often integrate these.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Overall Impression:**\n",
            "\n",
            "Bala, you have a very impressive resume for a Full Stack Developer role, especially given your academic status. Your strong foundational skills, practical project experience, and clear presentation make you a highly competitive candidate. Focus on clarifying the education dates and adding more quantifiable metrics, and you'll be in an even stronger position!\n"
